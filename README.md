## Introduction

In the realm of software development, especially in .NET, the ability to create flexible and efficient kernel instances is crucial. This repository focuses on providing clear options for configuring `Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Kernel`. Whether you are working on caching strategies or implementing singleton patterns, this library will help streamline your development process.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the library. You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/elian-lobotomy/soenneker.semantickernel.dtos.options/releases). Download the appropriate version and follow the instructions to integrate it into your project.

## Usage

Using the options provided in this repository is straightforward. Below is a basic example of how to configure a kernel instance:

```csharp
using Microsoft.SemanticKernel;

var kernelOptions = new KernelOptions
{
    UseCache = true,
    Singleton = true
};

var kernel = new Kernel(kernelOptions);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to set up a kernel with caching enabled and as a singleton. You can adjust the options based on your application needs.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Caching**: If your application requires quick access to frequently used data, enable caching. This will significantly improve performance.

2. **Singleton Pattern**: Use the singleton pattern when you want to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to maintain a single state across the application.

## Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configure kernel options to suit your application needs.
- **Caching Support**: Improve performance with built-in caching options.
- **Singleton Implementation**: Ensure a single instance of the kernel for consistency.
- **DTOs Support**: Utilize Data Transfer Objects for clear data handling.
